# 💥 The Workflow That Makes Cursor AI Actually Useful  
*A system that brings structure, task flow, and session memory to stateless AI development.*


---

Have you ever used Cursor AI and felt like it forgot everything you told it?
That’s not a bug — it’s how it’s built.
Cursor resets completely between sessions, and unless you give it structure, it can feel like you’re coding with amnesia.

I’ve been using Cursor for months. It’s an incredible assistant — fast, smart, and capable — but without structure, it can become chaotic. Prompts get misunderstood, tasks get lost in translation, and pausing mid-feature often means starting over.

That’s why I created the Persistent Build Workflow — not just to help Cursor remember, but to turn it into a reliable co-developer. PBW acts as a system for managing feature development, breaking down work into tasks, and tracking progress across sessions. It brings clarity, repeatability, and control to the way you build with AI — so you don’t just write code, you ship features with confidence.

## 🛠 What Is the Persistent Build Workflow?

The Persistent Build Workflow (PBW) is a structured framework designed to help stateless AI agents like Cursor act as reliable engineering collaborators by following a strict set of rules to build features.

It works by requiring Cursor to follow a repeatable routine:

- ✅ Read the entire memory bank (project docs + feature folder)  
- ✅ Plan the feature  
- ✅ Execute one task at a time  
- ✅ Track its work in real-time  
- ✅ Document what it built  

Every time Cursor restarts, it reads all relevant files again — restoring full situational awareness without ever needing long-term memory.

## 🚨 Why Cursor Without a Workflow Fails

Stateless AI like Cursor can feel frustrating when used without structure:

- ❌ Contextless prompts – Cursor doesn't know your architecture or business rules.  
- ❌ One-shot overkill – Prompts return bloated code that’s hard to verify or fix.  
- ❌ Repetitive clarifications – You keep repeating what you've already explained.  
- ❌ Lost continuity – You can’t pause work and reliably resume it later.  
- ❌ No traceability – It’s unclear what got done, by whom, or why.  

PBW solves all of this by simulating memory through markdown.

## 🔧 Feature Development Workflow

The feature development process follows a clear, structured flow using special prompts and tracked documentation:

### 1. 🚀 Kick Off with a Feature Prompt

Kick off by writing a prompt starting with:

```plaintext
@feature <feature-title>
@description <feature-description>
```

This initiates the workflow.

### 2. 🧠 Step 1: Context Setup

Cursor’s AI gathers context from both your input and the `/docs` directory, which is expected to contain design documents and code architecture.

It asks clarifying questions to better understand the feature requirements and saves the ongoing context in `context.md`.

### 3. 📄 Step 2: Implementation Plan

AI drafts a detailed plan (`prd.md`) with design, logic, files to change, and testing strategy. It moves forward only after your approval.

### 4. ✅ Step 3: Break into Tasks

AI breaks the plan into atomic tasks and tracks them in `tasks.md`.

### 5. 🔁 Step 4: Task-by-Task Execution

For each task:
- AI explains intended changes  
- Awaits your approval  
- Implements and marks the task as complete

### 6. 📘 Step 5: Final LLD Summary

After all tasks, AI generates `lld.md` — a complete technical summary for future reference.

### 🧠 Memory & Progress

Each step is tracked in `progress.md`. You can pause anytime and resume using:

```plaintext
Refresh memory bank <feature-title>
```

## 📁 Folder Structure Example

```bash
/my-project
├── docs/
│   ├── system-overview.md
│   ├── domain-model.md
│   ├── database-schema.md
│   └── error-handling.md
│
├── codeAssistant/
│   └── user-authentication/
│       ├── context.md
│       ├── prd.md
│       ├── tasks.md
│       ├── progress.md
│       └── lld.md
```

- `/docs/` contains reusable system knowledge Cursor should read for every feature.  
- `/codeAssistant/<feature>/` is Cursor’s personal logbook.

## ✨ Why Use the Persistent Build Workflow?

PBW isn’t just structure. It’s survival mode for stateless AI.

### 🧠 Cursor Thinks With Context  
PBW ensures Cursor always reads docs first, giving it deep understanding of your system.

### 🔁 You Can Pause Anytime  
Work is recorded in `progress.md` so you can resume at any point.

### ✅ Less Guessing, More Clarity  
- Concrete plans (`prd.md`)  
- Clear tasks (`tasks.md`)  
- Traceable logs (`progress.md`)  
- Final documentation (`lld.md`)

### 📚 Built-In Documentation  
Every feature is documented by design.

## 🧩 How to Enable PBW in Cursor

### 1. Add PBW Rules

Go to **Settings → Rules** and paste the cursor-persistent-build-workflow.d file: 


### 2. Add Docs

Create a `/docs/` folder:

- `system-overview.md`  
- `domain-model.md`  
- `database-schema.md`  
- `error-handling.md`  

### 3. Start a Feature

```bash
@feature <feature-title> <short description>
```

## 🧬 Final Thoughts

Cursor AI may be stateless, but your workflow doesn't have to be.

With PBW, you turn a forgetful assistant into a dependable developer. It reads, plans, executes, and documents — all without memory.
